         Hi, I'm Tina, it's nice to meet you! I'm currently studying computer engineering at the University of Guelph and
				 am extremely proud if it. I've been interested in technology since the moment I got my first Nintendo DS for my
				 birthday as a kid. Little Tina was amazed by the huge worlds I got to explore inside such a little device. When I was
				 in elementary school, math was my favourite subject, and in highschool I found a love for physics. These academic
				 prowesses combined with my love for games had me researching virtual reality technology and helped encouraged me make
				 the decision to study computer engineering in the first place.
				 </p>

        <p>
         Now I am ready to pursue a career in a STEM field as a future computer engineer! I am a focused, extremely
				 hard-working young woman and excel in not only my academics but also in extracurriculars. I am ambitious and take on
				 personal projects as well as complete school assignments with a high degree of excellence. Due to my strong
				 communication and leadership skills that I've deceloped from my athletics, I am able to work well with others as well as
				 produce work to the same caliber independently. I love what I study, and that passion drives me to do my best
				 everyday whether it's in class, or out of it. </p>
